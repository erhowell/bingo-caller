# Bingo Caller Project

2024 front end coding project

## Warning this is still a work in progress

## FAQ

- What is this?
  - With over 2 years of professional experience calling bingo underneath my belt, I am designing this application as a supplemental tool to get bingo callers to the next level. While nothing can replace the traditional cage and balls, this application will hopefully help both the casual bingo hobbiest or the high stakes bingo caller train for their next big event.
  - I am currently working on updates but this application already has the basics:
    - The option for a 75 or 90 ball game
    - Random ball draws and marking the ball as called
    - The option for users to set automatic ball draws or they can manually draw the next ball
    - Users can opt in to have the traditional corresponding bingo call shown for each ball drawn, or they can record their own to use during their sesson
    - This application is desktop and mobile compatible
- Why chose a bingo caller application for a project?
  - As I stated above, I am an avid bingo enthusiust. I got into bingo in 2021 in Las Vegas and then quickly became hooked. I was able to find a great bingo community in the area I reside in, and I was able to get the opportunity to become a bingo caller in 2022. I wanted to make this tool as a way to practive my timing and bingo calls before big events.
- What tools am I using to make this?
  - Right now I have been using Next.js framework and react with typescript and panda css framework. I wanted something quick and easy
- What am I currently working on for this project?
  - I'm still working on trying to make things look good.
  - I want to add functionality to bulk update custom bingo calls and settings and make it persist for the session
  - Create a database of bingo calls that people can contribute to.
  - Eventually I would like to have the ability to make bingo cards or possibly host virtual bingo games
- Where can you see me call bingo?
  - Currently I call at The Blacksheep Bar and Grill on Wednesdays 7:00 in Salt Lake City (the one close to U of U). Come say hi and win fun prizes
